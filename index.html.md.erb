This documentation describes the <%= vars.product_name %>.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

<%= vars.product_short %> gathers information about service instances from multiple

through the CF API and presents this information in a web UI.
From here, operators can view, filter, and delete service instances.


## <a id="features"></a>Key Features

Through <%= vars.product_short %>, operators can:

* View and filter service instances by foundation, org, space, service offering, status,
  service keys, service bindings, and bound apps
* Delete service instances

## <a id="reqs"></a>Requirements

<%= vars.product_short %> has the following requirements:

* <%= vars.platform_name %> (formerly <%= vars.platform_old %>) or open source Cloud Foundry
* [User Account and Authentication (UAA) server](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/uaa/uaa-overview.html)

## <a id="limitations"></a>Limitations

<%= vars.product_short %> has been tested with 2000 <%= vars.platform_name %> service instances across two <%= vars.platform_name %>
foundations.
Higher numbers might impact the performance of <%= vars.platform_name %> due to the large number of requests made to the Cloud Controller.
