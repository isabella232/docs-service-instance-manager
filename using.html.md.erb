This topic describes how to use Service Instance Manager for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF)
to view and delete service instances across PCF foundations.

## <a id="login"></a> Log in to Service Instance Manager

Follow the steps below to log in to Service Instance Manager.

1. Open a web browser and go to
<code>https<span>:</span>//service-instance-manager.YOUR-PCF-FOUNDATION-URL</code>.

1. Log in with the email address and password you use for that PCF foundation.

     <%= image_tag("images/cf-login-page.png", :alt => "Cloud Foundry login page") %><br>
  * If this is the only PCF foundation that Service Instance Manager is configured to target, the Service Instance Manager UI appears.
  * If Service Instance Manager is configured to target any other PCF foundations, you are redirected to the
      login page for the next foundation listed in `config.json`. Redirects continue until you have logged in to
      every foundation that Service Instance Manager targets.
    <%# To edit <code>config.json</code>, see <a href="insert link to doc section here when it exists">Edit config.json</a>. %>

1. Log in to each PCF foundation until the the Service Instance Manager UI appears.

## <a id="filter-instances"></a> Filter Service Instances

You can filter service instances by a variety of properties.

* To filter by name or GUID, enter a name or GUID in the search field.

    <%= image_tag("images/search-by-name.png", :alt => "A name in the search field") %>

* To filter by a category, enter the query in the search field in the format `FILTER:VALUE`.<br><br>

    <%= image_tag("images/filter-by-status.png", :alt => "Status filter in the search field") %>

    The available filters and examples of each are shown in the table below.

    <table>
        <thead>
        <tr>
        <th><strong>Filter</strong></th>
        <th><strong>Example</strong></th>
        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>app:BOUND-APP-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>app:my-app</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>foundation:FOUNDATION-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>foundation:my-foundation</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>org:ORG-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>org:my-org</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>space:SPACE-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>space:my-space</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>service:SERVICE-OFFERING-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>service:p-rabbitmq</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>status:ok</code> and <code>status:error</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center">-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>keys:true</code> and <code>keys:false</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center">-</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>bindings:true</code> and <code>bindings:false</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center">-</td>
        </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

      can only be used with the values shown in the <strong>Filter</strong> column.
