Follow the steps below to log in to Service Instance Manager and the foundation that contains service instances you want to manage.

You can filter service instances by a variety of properties.

    <%= image_tag("images/filter-by-status.png", :alt => "Status filter in the search field") %>

    The available filters are:

    * `app:BOUND-APP-NAME`

    * `status:ok` and `status:error`
    * `keys:true` and `keys:false`
    * `bindings:true` and `bindings:false`

* You can also filter by clicking on a filter bubble below the search field.
