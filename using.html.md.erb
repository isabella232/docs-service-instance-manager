<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

This topic describes how to use <%= vars.product_full %>
to view and delete service instances across <%= vars.platform_name %> foundations.

## <a id="login"></a> Log in to <%= vars.product_short %>

Follow the steps below to log in to <%= vars.product_short %>.

1. Open a web browser and go to
<code>https<span>:</span>//service-instance-manager.YOUR-PIVOTAL-PLATFORM-FOUNDATION-URL</code>.

1. Log in with the email address and password you use for that <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation.

     <%= image_tag("images/cf-login-page.png", :alt => "Cloud Foundry login page", :width => "250") %>
  * If this is the only <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation that <%= vars.product_short %> is configured to target, the <%= vars.product_short %> UI appears.
  * If <%= vars.product_short %> is configured to target any other <%= vars.platform_name %> foundations, you are redirected to the
      login page for the next foundation listed in `config.json`. Redirects continue until you have logged in
      to every foundation that <%= vars.product_short %> targets.

1. Log in to each <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation until the the <%= vars.product_short %> UI appears.

## <a id="filter-instances"></a> Filter Service Instances

You can filter service instances by a variety of properties.

* To filter by service instance name or GUID, enter a name or GUID in the search field.

    <%= image_tag("images/search-by-name.png", :alt => "A name in the search field") %>

* To filter by a category, enter the query in the search field in the format
`FILTER:VALUE`, or filter by clicking on a filter tag below the search field.<br><br>

    <%= image_tag("images/filter-by-status.png", :alt => "Status filter in the search field") %>

    The available filters and their associated tags are shown in the table below.

    You also can combine the above filters to further narrow your search.

    For example:

    ```
    foundation:Bluemonday older_than:2w6d
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> <code>status</code>, <code>keys</code>, and <code>bindings</code>
      can only be used with the values shown in the <strong>Searching byâ€¦</strong> column.

## <a id="service-consumption"></a> Service Consumption

<%= vars.product_short %> provides an overview of the filtered foundations and their service instances.
 The information is provided in summary boxes and in a graph of service instance status.

<%= image_tag("images/consumption.gif", :alt => "Service Consumption") %>

The default graph will show a summary of the status of the filtered service instances.
The bars can be grouped by foundation, org, service offering, bound state, or last operation status.
The bars may be split by bound status, last operation status, or service offering.

<%= image_tag("images/graph_offering_operation.png", :alt => "Summary graph by service offering and last operation statuses") %>

<%= image_tag("images/graph_org_offering.png", :alt => "Summary graph by org and service offering") %>

The summary boxes provide information about foundations, orgs, service offerings, total service instances, unbound service instances, and failed operations with the applied filters.

## <a id="delete-instances"></a> Delete Service Instances

<%= vars.product_short %> enables you to either delete individual service instances
or delete multiple service instances based on a search or filter.
You cannot delete service instances with service bindings, service keys, or route associations.

To delete service instances:

1. Filter for service instances without service bindings, service keys.
You can filter further if necessary.
For instructions on how to use these filters others, see [Filter Service Instances](#filter-instances).

1. Use the checkboxes to select the instances you want to delete.

1. Click **DELETE**.

1. Click **DELETE** in the delete service instance dialog box.
