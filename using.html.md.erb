  * If this is the only PCF foundation that Service Instance Manager is configured to target, the Service Instance Manager UI appears.
  * If Service Instance Manager is configured to target any other PCF foundations, you are redirected to the
      login page for the next foundation listed in `config.json`. Redirects continue until you have logged in
      to every foundation that Service Instance Manager targets.

1. Log in to each PCF foundation until the the Service Instance Manager UI appears.

## <a id="filter-instances"></a> Filter Service Instances

You can filter service instances by a variety of properties.

* To filter by name or GUID, enter a name or GUID in the search field.

    <%= image_tag("images/search-by-name.png", :alt => "A name in the search field") %>

* To filter by a category, enter the query in the search field in the format `FILTER:VALUE`.<br><br>

    <%= image_tag("images/filter-by-status.png", :alt => "Status filter in the search field") %>

    The available filters and examples of each are shown in the table below.

    <table>

        </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
        <tr>
        <td><code>app:BOUND-APP-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>app:go-app-45</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>foundation:FOUNDATION-NAME</code></td>
        <td><code>foundation:Bluemonday</code></td>
        </tr>

        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>status:ok</code> and <code>status:error</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center"><em>n/a</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>keys:true</code> and <code>keys:false</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center"><em>n/a</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>bindings:true</code> and <code>bindings:false</code></td>
        <td style="text-align:center"><em>n/a</em></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
        <td><code>younger_than:</code> and <code>older_than:</code></td>
        <td><code>younger_than:4y2m</code>, <code>older_than:2w6d</code><br>
        Filter by y (years), m (months), w (weeks), and d (days).</td>
        </tr>
