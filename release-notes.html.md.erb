##<a id="0-5-0"></a> v0.5.0

**Release Date:** November 7, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Improved UI to make it easier to browse service instances.
Service instances are now displayed in a table rather than as cards.

- Users can delete multiple instances based on search or filter with two clicks.
For instructions, see [Delete Service Instances](./using.html#delete-instances).

- Users can see the current plan of each service instance.

- Admin users can see the names of up to five Space Managers of the space that a
service is located in.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

- When installing Service Instance Manager using the `install.sh` script,
the UAA instructions that are printed to the terminal no longer tell you to run an incorrect command.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

<%= partial vars.path_to_partials + '/sim/ki-too-many-service-instances' %>

* The error message `[OUT] TypeError: Cannot read property 'imageUrl' of null` shows
on foundations that do not provide the `imageUrl` field for a service offering.

* The instructions in the installation script and README file in the release
  artifact do not include the `cloud_controller.admin` scope on the UAA client that
  you create in each target foundation.
  Depending on how you have created the orgs and spaces in your foundations,
  you might require this scope to allow an admin user to see all
  service instances in <%= vars.product_short %>.<br><br>

    To avoid this issue, Pivotal recommends that existing users update their SIM UAA clients to include this scope.
    To do this, see [<%= vars.product_short %> Is Not Showing All Service Instances](./installing.html#instances-not-shown).
