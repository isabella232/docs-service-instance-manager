### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* First public release of <%= vars.product_name %>
* View all service instances from across multiple <%= vars.platform_name %> foundations
* Search for a specific service instance to speed up troubleshooting
* Filter service instances by name, ID, org, space, foundation, and bound apps
* Filter for service instances that are candidates for cleanup

* Support for enterprise identity providers

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* When targeting a <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation with tens of thousands of service instances, <%= vars.product_short %> can deny service to the Cloud Controller.
* When logged in with a user that has audit (read-only) access to a service instance, attempting to delete the service instance triggers a JSON error message.
