### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

This might cause the Cloud Controller to be slow to respond to requests, or not respond at all.
For how to troubleshoot this issue, see [The Cloud Controller is Slow to Respond to Requests](./installing.html#cc-unresponsive).

* Targeting many <%= vars.platform_name %> foundations may result in a status code 431 Header fields too large error.
