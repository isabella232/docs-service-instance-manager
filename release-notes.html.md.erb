##<a id="0-5-0"></a> v0.5.0

**Release Date:** November 7, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Improved UI to make it easier to browse service instances.
Service instances are now displayed in a table rather than as cards.

- Users can delete multiple instances based on search or filter with two clicks.
For instructions, see [Delete Service Instances](./using.html#delete-instances).

- Users can see the current plan of each service instance.

- Admin users can see the names of up to five Space Managers of the space that a
service is located in.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

- When installing Service Instance Manager using the `install.sh` script,
the UAA instructions that are printed to the terminal no longer tell you to run an incorrect command.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* When targeting a <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation with tens of thousands of
service instances, <%= vars.product_short %> can deny service to the Cloud Controller.
This might cause the Cloud Controller to be slow to respond to requests, or not respond at all.
For how to troubleshoot this issue, see [The Cloud Controller is Slow to Respond to Requests](./installing.html#cc-unresponsive).

* The error message `[OUT] TypeError: Cannot read property 'imageUrl' of null` shows
on foundations that do not provide the `imageUrl` field for a service offering.

* The README.txt and install script included in the artifact for this version of SIM instructs users to create a UAA client that lacks the "cloud_controller.admin" scope.
Depending on how customers have created the orgs and spaces in their foundations, the "cloud_controller.admin" scope may be required for an admin user to be able to see all service instances in SIM. We have updated our docs to include this scope on all SIM UAA clients, and we suggest that existing users update their clients.
Recommended actions:
- Update the scopes of the UAA client on each target foundation by running the following command:
`uaac client update "fleet-manager" --scope "cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,cloud_controller.admin_read_only,cloud_controller.admin,cloud_controller.global_auditor"`
