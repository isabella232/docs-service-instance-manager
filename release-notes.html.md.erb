**Release Date:** October 23, 2019


### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- <%= vars.product_name %> now shows the age of each service instance and the
time since the instance was last updated.
- Added the filters `older_than` and `younger_than` so that you can filter service instances by age.
For more information, see <a href="using.html#filter-instances">Filter Service Instances</a>.


### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

* When logged in with a user that has audit (read-only) access to a service instance,
attempting to delete the service instance no longer triggers a JSON error message.


### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

- When installing Service Instance Manager using the `install.sh` script,
the UAA instructions that are printed to the terminal tell you to run `uaac client token get`.
This is incorrect.
The correct command is `uaac token client get`.

- When targeting a <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation with tens of thousands of
service instances, <%= vars.product_short %> can deny service to the Cloud Controller.
This might cause the Cloud Controller to be slow to respond to requests, or not respond at all.
For how to troubleshoot this issue, see [The Cloud Controller is Slow to Respond to Requests](./installing.html#cc-unresponsive).
