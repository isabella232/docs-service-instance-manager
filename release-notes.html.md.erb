##<a id="0-5-0"></a> v0.5.0

**Release Date:** November 7, 2019

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

- Improved UI to make it easier to browse service instances.
Service instances are now displayed in a table rather than as cards.

- Users can delete multiple instances based on search or filter with two clicks.
For instructions, see [Delete Service Instances](./using.html#delete-instances).

- Users can see the current plan of each service instance.

- Admin users can see the names of up to five Space Managers of the space that a
service is located in.

### Resolved Issues

This release has the following fix:

- When installing Service Instance Manager using the `install.sh` script,
the UAA instructions that are printed to the terminal no longer tell you to run an incorrect command.

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* When targeting a <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation with tens of thousands of
service instances, <%= vars.product_short %> can deny service to the Cloud Controller.
This might cause the Cloud Controller to be slow to respond to requests, or not respond at all.
For how to troubleshoot this issue, see [The Cloud Controller is Slow to Respond to Requests](./installing.html#cc-unresponsive).

* The error message `[OUT] TypeError: Cannot read property 'imageUrl' of null` shows
on foundations that do not provide the `imageUrl` field for a service offering.

* The instructions in the installation script and the README file in the release
  artifact do not include the `cloud_controller.admin` scope on the UAA client that
  you create in each target foundation.

    Depending on how you have created the orgs and spaces in your foundations,
    you might require the `cloud_controller.admin` scope to allow an admin user to see all
    service instances in <%= vars.product_short %>.

    Pivotal recommends that existing users update their SIM UAA clients to include this scope.
    To do this, see []().

    Recommended actions:

      * Update the scopes of the UAA client on each target foundation by running the following command:
    `uaac client update "fleet-manager" --scope "cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,cloud_controller.admin_read_only,cloud_controller.admin,cloud_controller.global_auditor"`
