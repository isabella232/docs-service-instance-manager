**Release Date:** January 3, 2020

### Features

New features and changes in this release:

* Added a Service Consumption Dashboard, which displays information about service consumption patterns across
all targeted foundations.
For more information, see [View Consumption of Service Instances](./using.html#service-consumption).

### Known Issues

This release has the following issues:

* When targeting a <%= vars.platform_name %> foundation with more than 2000
service instances, <%= vars.product_short %> can deny service to the Cloud Controller.
This might cause the Cloud Controller to respond to requests slowly, or not at all.
For how to troubleshoot this issue,
see [The Cloud Controller is Slow to Respond to Requests](./installing.html#cc-unresponsive).

* Targeting more than five <%= vars.platform_name %> foundations can
result in the status code error `431 Request Header Fields Too Large`.
