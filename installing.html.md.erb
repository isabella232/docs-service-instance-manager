This topic provides instructions for operators for how to install and configure Service Instance Manager.


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

Service Instance Manager consists of two Cloud Foundry apps. These are deployed on a single host Cloud Foundry.

The apps are:

* <code>service-instance-manager-api</code>, which communicates with the Cloud Controller of all target foundations.
* <code>service-instance-manager</code>, which hosts the web UI.

<br>
To install and configure Service Instance Manager:

1. [Download Service Instance Manager](#download)
1. [Configure the API App](#api-app)
1. [Deploy the Apps](#deploying)
1. [Create a UAA client](#create-client)


## <a id='networking'></a> About Networking for Service Instance Manager

Before you begin installation, here are a few things to know about the networking and routing for the Service Instance Manager:

* The `service-instance-manager-api` app must be able to reach the Cloud Controller API for each target
foundation. Depending on the network setup, extra steps might be required to allow traffic from the app to
the target foundation.

* The `service-instance-manager` web app only requires a connection to the `service-instance-manager-api`.
The web app does not connect directly to the target foundations.

* Because of browser cross-origin access, the `service-instance-manager-api` API app and the
`service-instance-manager-api` web app must be pushed with the same route. The web app expects the API app to
 be available at `/api`.


## <a id='requirements'></a> Prerequisites

Before you install and configure Service Instance Manager, you must have:

1. The cf CLI. For how to install it, see
<a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/cf-cli/install-go-cli.html">Installing the cf CLI</a>
in the Cloud Foundry documentation.

1. The User Account and Authentication Command Line Interface (UAAC).
For how to install it, see <a href="https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cf-uaac">cf-uaac</a> on GitHub.


## <a id='download'></a> Download Service Instance Manager

Download the latest version of Service Instance Manager from
<a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/service-instance-manager/">Pivotal Network</a>.

## <a id='api-app'></a> Configure the API App

To configure the API app:

1. Unzip the Service Instance Manager tarball you downloaded.

1. Open the <code>config.json</code> file that you just extracted from the tarball in a text editor.

1. Edit <code>config.json</code> to include a section for each target foundation, as in the example below.

    ```json
    [
      {
        "name":"YOUR-PRODUCTION-PCF-DEPLOYMENT",
        "cfApi":"SYS.PRODCF.EXAMPLE.COM"
      },
      {
        "name":"DEV-PCF-DEPLOYMENT",
        "cfApi":"DEV-SYSTOM-DOMAIN.EXAMPLE.COM",
        "client_id":"CUSTOM-UAA-CLIENT-ID",
        "identityProviderName":"YOUR-SAML-PROVIDER"
       }
       ...
    ]
    ```

    Where:
    <ul>
      <li><code>YOUR-PRODUCTION-PCF-DEPLOYMENT</code> is a human-readable name for the target foundation.</li>
      <li><code>SYS.PRODCF.EXAMPLE.COM</code> is the URL of the API endpoint for the target foundation.</li>
      <li><code>CUSTOM-UAA-CLIENT-ID</code> is the <code>client_id</code> in the UAA of the target foundation.
        You can create this client by following the steps in <a href="#create-client">Create a UAA Client</a>
        below. If you do not set a custom ID, the ID <code>fleet-manager</code> is used.</li>
      <li><code>YOUR-SAML-PROVIDER</code> is the name of the identity provider that you can optionally configure
        for UAA. If an identity provider is configured, the user need only log in once to use Service Instance
        Manager. If you do not know the name of your identity provider, follow steps 1â€“4 of
        <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsguide/auth-sso.html#configure-pcf-for-saml">Configure PAS as a Service Provider for SAML</a>.</li>
    </ul>

## <a id='deploying'></a> Deploy the Apps

To install Service Instance Manager, deploy the apps that you downloaded:

1. Log in to the cf CLI for the Cloud Foundry on which you want to host Service Instance
Manager by running:

    ```
    cf api https://api.HOST-CLOUD-FOUNDRY-DOMAIN
    cf auth
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ cf api https://api.my-cloud-foundry.example.com
    $ cf auth
    </pre>

1. Target the org and space to deploy Service Instance Manager in by running:

    ```
    cf target -o HOST-ORG -s HOST-SPACE
    ```

1. Execute the installation script `install.sh` to push the API and web apps by running:

    ```
    ./install.sh
    ```
   This passes the `config.json` to the API app.


## <a id='create-client'></a> Create UAA Clients

Before logging in to Service Instance Manager, you must create a client in the UAA of each target Cloud
Foundry. This client is used to authenticate on behalf of the user when a user logs in to Service Instance
Manager.

This means that Service Instance Manager only has the permissions available to that user on each target
foundation.

To create the clients in each target foundation, perform the following steps for each foundation:

1. Retrieve the UAA admin credentials for the foundation from the Pivotal Application Service (PAS) tile in
Ops Manager. These are found at **Credentials** &gt; **UAA** &gt; **Admin Client Credentials**.

1. Target and authenticate with UAA for the foundation by running:

    ```
    uaac target uaa.YOUR-DOMAIN
    uaac token client get
    ```

    For example:

    <pre class="terminal">
    $ uaac target uaa.target-cf-system-domain.example.com
    $ uaac token client get
    </pre>
    This command prompts for the admin credentials of UAA that you retrieved
    in the previous step.

1. Retrieve the route where the Service Instance Manager app is deployed on the host Cloud Foundry by running:

    ```
    cf app service-instance-manager
    export SIM-ROUTE="$(cf app service-instance-manager | grep routes | awk '{ print $2 }')"
    ```
    <p class="note">
      <strong>Note:</strong> The <code>SIM-ROUTE</code> is the same for every
      client in each target foundation. <code>SIM-ROUTE</code> must not contain a hyphen.
      <code>redirect_uri</code> is used by UAA to confirm that the request for
      authentication is coming from a known location.
    </p>

1.  Add the client to UAA by running:

    ```
    uaac client add "fleet-manager"  \
        --name "Fleet Manager client for Service Instance Manager" \
        --scope "cloud_controller.read,cloud_controller.write,cloud_controller.admin_read_only,cloud_controller.global_auditor" \
        --authorized_grant_types "implicit" \
        --redirect_uri "http://${SIM-ROUTE}/**,https://${SIM-ROUTE}/**" \
        --autoapprove "true" \
        --secret ""
    ```

    Where `SIM-ROUTE` is the route where the Service Instance Manager app is deployed on the host Cloud
    Foundry that you retrieved in the previous step. `SIM-ROUTE` must not contain a hyphen.

Service Instance Manager is now accessible at the route it was pushed to.


## <a id='ts'></a> Troubleshooting

This section provides troubleshooting information for the installation process.

### <a id='bp-unavailable'></a> Buildpack Unavailable

#### Symptom

During deployment of Service Instance Manager, the <code>cf push</code> command outputs the following error:

<pre class="terminal">
$ Failed to clone git repository at https://github.com/cloudfoundry/nodejs-buildpack.git
</pre>

#### Explanation

The host Cloud Foundry cannot retrieve the NodeJS buildpack from GitHub.

#### Solution

1. Look up the buildpack version listed in the `service-instance-manager/api/manifest.yml`.
1. Download the corresponding buildpack version from
<a href="https://network.pivotal.io/products/nodejs-buildpack">NodeJS Buildpack</a> or GitHub.

1. Install the buildpack by running:

    ```
    cf create-buildpack BUILDPACK-PATH
    ```
